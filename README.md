** Style Guide for Software Engineering Daily Apps

This is, as the title states, a guide for the visual components so that the apps have a consistent look across Android, iOS, and web. All situations and uses won't be covered explicitly, but common use cases will be mentioned and diagrammed so a lot of the design choices will be taken care of.

I plan on starting off with the basics, such as Typography, colors, and reusable components, and eventually working up to full-page / feature designs

*** Typography

I have included .otf files for the fonts used so you can import them into the mobile apps. For web usage, these fonts are available on Google fonts here: [Cabin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin) and [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand). They are free for commercial-use so there shouldn't be an issue with using them across the apps.

Comments redesign, newsfeed view, make style guide into web app, tbd...
